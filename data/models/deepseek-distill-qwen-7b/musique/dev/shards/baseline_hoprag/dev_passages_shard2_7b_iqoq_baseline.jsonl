Since its inception, Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture and the national continuity of the Greek world is a lot more certain than its demographic. Yet, Hellenism also embodied an ancestral dimension through aspects of Athenian literature that developed and influenced ideas of descent based on autochthony. During the later years of the Eastern Roman Empire, areas such as Ionia and Constantinople experienced a Hellenic revival in language, philosophy, and literature and on classical models of thought and scholarship. This revival provided a powerful impetus to the sense of cultural affinity with ancient Greece and its classical heritage. The cultural changes undergone by the Greeks are, despite a surviving common sense of ethnicity, undeniable. At the same time, the Greeks have retained their language and alphabet, certain values and cultural traditions, customs, a sense of religious and cultural difference and exclusion, (the word barbarian was used by 12th-century historian Anna Komnene to describe non-Greek speakers), a sense of Greek identity and common sense of ethnicity despite the global political and social changes of the past two millennia.", "IQs": ["json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the documented tradition of the Greek language?\",\"When did the Greek language's tradition begin and end?\",\"How did the Hellenic revival in areas like Ionia and Constantinople influence cultural identity?\",\"What aspects of Greek identity were emphasized despite global changes over two millennia?\"]}"], "OQs": ["<think>", "Okay, so I need to generate follow-up questions based on the provided news sentences.
