Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland).

Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health.

{"passage_id": "2hop__566_568792_sent14", "title": "Frédéric Chopin", "text": "Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange's fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger. The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice. Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain. As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her \"third child\". In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \"child,\" a \"little angel\", a \"sufferer\" and a \"beloved little corpse.\" In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer's galleys. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made \"a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship.\" The two would never meet again.", "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the provided sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is their eighth studio album scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the genre of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who produced the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the theme of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the target audience for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the critical reception of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the commercial success of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the lyrical content of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the musical style of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the production quality of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the packaging of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the marketing strategy for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the promotional campaign for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\","], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz.

The iPod line came from Apple's \"digital hub\" category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \"big and clunky or small and useless\" with user interfaces that were \"unbelievably awful,\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product (\"the Walkman of the twenty-first century\" ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5 GB hard drive that put \"1,000 songs in your pocket.\"", "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the given sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is their eighth studio album scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the producer of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the genre of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the lead singer of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the engineer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the mixer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the mastering engineer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the graphic designer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the photographer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\". He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted Paul Ekman, a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and surprise. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around. Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were schadenfreude, ennui, pride, and hope. Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships. Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.The smash success of Docter's 2009 film Up encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story. Inside Out is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer John Lasseter, who was focused on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios in Burbank at the time of its production. Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making Inside Out, but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.", "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the provided sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is their eighth studio album scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the lead singer of the band?\", \"What genre of music does the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' belong to?\", \"What is the name of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the producer of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the engineer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the mixer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the mastering engineer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the artwork designer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the photographer who took the cover photo for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\","], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

Prototypes were developed by Philips and Sony independently in the late 1970s. In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the Red Book CD-DA standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984. The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between Philips and Sony, who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware.

Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's. After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group's own ideas. Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the \"Snow White\" design language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers. However, Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last; after an internal power struggle with new CEO John Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985. He went on to found NeXT, another computer company targeting the education market, and did not return until 1997, when Apple acquired NeXT.", "IQs": ["Here is the JSON response with the generated questions:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What's the name of their eighth album?\",\"When was the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the lead singer of the band?\", \"What genre of music does the band specialize in?\", \"What is the name of the band?\", \"What is the name of the producer of the album?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album?\", \"What is the name of the album's first single?\", \"What is the name of the album's second single?\", \"What is the name of the album's third single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fourth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fifth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's sixth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's seventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eighth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's ninth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's tenth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eleventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's twelfth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's thirteenth single?\", \"What is the name of"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\". He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted Paul Ekman, a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and surprise. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around. Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were schadenfreude, ennui, pride, and hope. Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships. Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.The smash success of Docter's 2009 film Up encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story. Inside Out is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer John Lasseter, who was focused on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios in Burbank at the time of its production. Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making Inside Out, but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.", "IQs": ["Here is the JSON response with the generated questions:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the lead singer of the band?\", \"What genre of music does the band specialize in?\", \"What is the name of the band?\", \"What is the name of the producer of the album?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album?\", \"What is the name of the album's lead single?\", \"What is the name of the album's second single?\", \"What is the name of the album's third single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fourth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fifth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's sixth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's seventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eighth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's ninth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's tenth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eleventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's twelfth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's thirteenth single?\", \"What is the name of"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

It would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal help (sending them limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating that fights for the colonies would most likely be lost anyway.

Similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any French ruler. Given these military necessities, the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the continent, hoping for victories closer to home. The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then, in treaty negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas possessions. This approach did not serve France well in the war, as the colonies were indeed lost, but although much of the European war went well, by its end France had few counterbalancing European successes.", "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the provided sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is their eighth studio album scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the genre of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who produced the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the theme of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the critical reception of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the commercial success of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the lyrical content of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the musical style of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the instrumentation of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the vocal style of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the production quality of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the packaging of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the cover art of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \""], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the best way to make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty - related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost - effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking.

A round-off entry vault, called a Yurchenko, is the most common vault in elite level gymnastics. When performing a yurchenko, gymnasts \"round-off\" so hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard (beatboard). From the roundoff position the gymnast travels backwards and executes a backhandspring so that the hands land on the vaulting table. The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations.

There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.", "vec_id": 3380, "keywords_text": ["afro-asiatic", "berber", "c._3200_bc", "coptic", "demotic_and_coptic", "egyptian", "memphis", "middle_egyptian", "old_egyptian", "semitic", "sumerian", "the_egyptian_orthodox_church", "the_middle_ages", "thebes"], "IQs": ["Here is the JSON response with the generated questions:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What's the name of their eighth album?\",\"When was the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the lead singer of the band?\", \"What genre of music does the band specialize in?\", \"What is the name of the band?\", \"What is the name of the producer of the album?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album?\", \"What is the name of the album's first single?\", \"What is the name of the album's second single?\", \"What is the name of the album's third single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fourth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fifth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's sixth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's seventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eighth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's ninth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's tenth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eleventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's twelfth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's thirteenth single?\", \"What is the name of"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the Republic of China, Standard Mandarin was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan (dialects). Cantonese is still the most commonly used language in Hong Kong, Macau and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas Southern Min has been accepted in Taiwan as an important local language along with Mandarin.", "vec_id": 3462, "keywords_text": ["beijing", "cantonese", "china", "chinese", "gan", "hakka", "hong_kong", "macau", "mandarin", "middle_chinese", "southern_min", "taiwan", "the_last_two_thousand_years", "the_republic_of_china", "wu", "xiang", "yue"], "IQs": ["Here is the JSON response with the generated questions:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the producer of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the genre of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the lead singer of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the label that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the album that preceded '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the album that followed '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the song that opens the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the song that closes the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the song that features on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' and was released as a single?\", \"What is"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include – but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor in order to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on this type of match is the WWE's Royal Rumble where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match and other wrestlers follow in 90 second intervals (previously 2 minutes) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring.

Although the written characters remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions has developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including Xiang, Wu, Gan, Min, Yue (Cantonese), and Hakka often show traces of Old Chinese or Middle Chinese. From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties.

Perdue says that Wang Anshi (1021–1086), realizing that China could not produce enough militarily capable steeds, had also aimed to obtain horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea. The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army's supply wagons. The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement.

Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia, parts of northern India, the Buryat Republic, the Tuva Republic, and in the Republic of Kalmykia and some other parts of China.
