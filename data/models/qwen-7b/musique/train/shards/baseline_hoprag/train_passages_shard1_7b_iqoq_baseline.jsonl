{"passage_id": "2hop__63119_153058_sent0", "title": "Buddhism", "text": "Mahayana Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from Nagarjuna (perhaps c. 150–250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahayana tradition. Nagarjuna's primary contribution to Buddhist philosophy was the systematic exposition of the concept of śūnyatā, or \"emptiness\", widely attested in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras that emerged in his era. The concept of emptiness brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and dependent origination, to refute the metaphysics of Sarvastivada and Sautrantika (extinct non-Mahayana schools). For Nagarjuna, it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of ātman; all phenomena (dharmas) are without any svabhava (literally \"own-nature\" or \"self-nature\"), and thus without any underlying essence; they are \"empty\" of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as the Mādhyamaka. Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the agamas. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the Canon. In the eyes of Nagarjuna the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Mādhyamaka system.", "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the provided sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"How did the band prepare for the release of the album?\", \"What is the theme or message behind the album?\", \"How did the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' compare to their previous works?\", \"What was the critical reception of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the commercial success of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the impact of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' on the band's career?\", \"What was the creative process behind the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the inspiration behind the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the production process like for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the recording process like for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the mixing and mastering process like for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the artwork and packaging for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

This understanding of youth was based on two then new ways of understanding human behavior: Darwin's evolutionary theory and Freud's psychodynamic theory. He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as Erik Erikson and Anna Freud started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between identity formation and role fulfillment. Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion. The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer relations and cultural influence, were left largely ignored until the 1980s.

Large parts of the country, especially the coastal areas, were closed to all but the Soviet military. Most of the sea shore and all sea islands (including Saaremaa and Hiiumaa) were declared \"border zones\". People not actually residing there were restricted from travelling to them without a permit. A notable closed military installation was the city of Paldiski, which was entirely closed to all public access. The city had a support base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet's submarines and several large military bases, including a nuclear submarine training centre complete with a full-scale model of a nuclear submarine with working nuclear reactors. The Paldiski reactors building passed into Estonian control in 1994 after the last Russian troops left the country. Immigration was another effect of Soviet occupation.

Some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped Congress's Constitutionally - defined task of declaring war. While historically presidents initiated the process for going to war, they asked for and received formal war declarations from Congress for the War of 1812, the Mexican -- American War, the Spanish -- American War, World War I, and World War II, although President Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903 did not get Congressional assent. Presidents have initiated war without Congressional war declarations; Truman called the Korean War a ``police action ''and the Vietnam War lasted over a decade without a declaration of war. In 1970, Time magazine noted:`` All told, it has been calculated, U.S. presidents have ordered troops into position or action without a formal congressional declaration a total of 149 times'' before 1970. In 1993, one writer noted ``Congress's war power has become the most flagrantly disregarded provision in the Constitution, ''and that the`` real erosion (of Congressional authority to declare war) began after World War II.'' President George H.W. Bush claimed he could begin Operation Desert Storm and launch a ``deliberate, unhurried, post -- Cold War decision to start a war ''without Congressional approval.

By 1871 there were 18 boys and 18 girls who attended the new school and in 1872 a school committee was formed who assumed responsibility for the ongoing management of the school, which had previously been the remit of the rector and the Churchwardens. A school mistress was also appointed in this year at a salary of £22 10s a year. In 1892, the cost of the general management and upkeep of the school was £64. The number of pupils two years later was just 16. In 1900 the school attendance had increased to 22, due to the closure of Laughton school and the subsequent transfer of its students to Mowsley.

Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor. Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection: it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry, biogeography, geology, morphology, and embryology. Debate over Darwin's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution, but the specific mechanism he proposed, natural selection, was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s. Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution. Alternatives to natural selection suggested during ``the eclipse of Darwinism ''(c. 1880 to 1920) included inheritance of acquired characteristics (neo-Lamarckism), an innate drive for change (orthogenesis), and sudden large mutations (saltationism). Mendelian genetics, a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900, was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher, J.B.S.

According to the theory of reasoned action, if people evaluate the suggested behavior as positive (attitude), and if they think their significant others want them to perform the behavior (subjective norm), this results in a higher intention (motivations) and they are more likely to do so. A high correlation of attitudes and subjective norms to behavioral intention, and subsequently to behavior, has been confirmed in many studies.", "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the provided sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is their eighth studio album scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some potential follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What was the inspiration behind the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"How did the band prepare for the release of the album?\", \"What was the critical reception of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"How did the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' compare to their previous works?\", \"What was the production process like for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What were some of the challenges faced during the creation of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"How did the band promote the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the impact of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' on the band's career?\", \"How did the band members feel about the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What was the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' in the band's discography?\"]}"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

Benioff and Weiss stated that they were unable to produce 10 episodes in the show's usual 12 to 14 month time frame, as Weiss said`` It's crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule.'' HBO confirmed on July 18, 2016, that the seventh season would consist of seven episodes, and would premiere later than usual in mid-2017 because of the later filming schedule. Later it was confirmed that the season would debut on July 16. According to a report by Entertainment Weekly, the seventh season of the series includes its longest episode, with the finale running for 81 minutes. The penultimate episode also runs for 71 minutes -- around 16 minutes longer than an average Game of Thrones episode. The first five episodes mostly run longer than average (55 minutes), at 59, 59, 63, 50, and 59 minutes respectively. The previous longest episode in the series was the sixth - season finale, ``The Winds of Winter '', which ran 69 minutes.", "IQs": ["Here is the JSON response with the generated questions:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the lead singer of the band?\", \"What genre of music does the band play?\", \"What is the name of the band?\", \"What is the name of the producer of the album?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album?\", \"What is the name of the album's first single?\", \"What is the name of the album's second single?\", \"What is the name of the album's third single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fourth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fifth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's sixth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's seventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eighth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's ninth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's tenth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eleventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's twelfth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's thirteenth single?\", \"What is the name of the"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language, but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet.

Hitler believed the Luftwaffe was \"the most effective strategic weapon\", and in reply to repeated requests from the Kriegsmarine for control over aircraft insisted, \"We should never have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an undivided Luftwaffe\". Such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in Göring a jealous and damaging defence of his \"empire\" while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the Luftwaffe at either the strategic or operational level. When Hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war, he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and Göring, which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over.

Although the written characters remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions has developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including Xiang, Wu, Gan, Min, Yue (Cantonese), and Hakka often show traces of Old Chinese or Middle Chinese. From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the Republic of China, Standard Mandarin was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan (dialects).

Forester asked him to provide details of his experiences in North Africa which Forester hoped to use in an article in The Saturday Evening Post. Instead of the notes which Forester expected, Dahl sent a finished story for which he was paid $900. The work led to The Gremlins, a serialised story in Cosmopolitan about a mischievous and fictional RAF creature, the gremlin; the work was published as Dahl's first novel in 1943. Dahl continued to write short stories, although these were all aimed at the adult market. They were sold to magazines and newspapers, and were later compiled into collections, the first of which was published in 1946. Dahl began to make up bedtime stories for the children, and these formed the basis of several of his stories. His first children's novel, James and the Giant Peach, was published in 1961, which was followed, along with others, by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), Fantastic Mr Fox (1970), Danny, the Champion of the World (1975), The BFG (1982) and Matilda in 1988.", "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the provided sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the lead singer of the band?\", \"What genre of music does the band specialize in?\", \"What is the name of the band?\", \"What is the name of the producer of the album?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album?\", \"What is the name of the album's lead single?\", \"What is the name of the album's second single?\", \"What is the name of the album's third single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fourth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fifth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's sixth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's seventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eighth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's ninth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's tenth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eleventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's twelfth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's thirteenth single?\","], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

New England and the Iroquois Confederacy fought New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy. The Iroquois dominated the economically important Great Lakes fur trade and had been in conflict with New France since 1680. At the urging of New England, the Iroquois interrupted the trade between New France and the western tribes. In retaliation, New France raided Seneca lands of western New York. In turn, New England supported the Iroquois in attacking New France, which they did by raiding Lachine.There were similar tensions on the border between New England and Acadia, which New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine.

The marten was listed as endangered by the COSEWIC in 2001 and has been protected since 1934, however the population still declines. The Newfoundland marten has been geographically and reproductively isolated from the mainland marten population for 7000 years. The Newfoundland pine marten is similar in appearance to its continental cousin, but is slightly larger, with dark brown fur with an orange/yellow patch on the throat. Females are an average weight of 772 grams and males have an average weight of 1275 grams. The Newfoundland subspecies is also observed to inhabit a wider range of forest types than its mainland counterparts. The population characteristics suggest that the Newfoundland marten is a product of unique ecological setting and evolutionary selective factors acting on the isolated island population. The Newfoundland pine marten is omnivorous, feeding on mainly small mammals, along with birds, old carcasses, insects and fruits; it is currently found in suitable pockets of mature forest habitat, on the west coast of Newfoundland and in and around Terra Nova National Park.

After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006–07 season.

The Biopsychological Theory of Personality was created after Gray disagreed with Hans Eysenck's arousal theory that dealt with biological personality traits. Eysenck looked at the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) for answering questions about personality. The ARAS is part of the brain structure and has been proposed to deal with cortical arousal, hence the term arousal theory. Eysenck compared levels of arousal to a scale of introversion versus extraversion.

The Herero Chief's Council submitted a number of petitions to the UN calling for it to grant Namibia independence during the 1950s. During the 1960s, when European powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in Africa, pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia. In 1966 the International Court of Justice dismissed a complaint brought by Ethiopia and Liberia against South Africa's continued presence in the territory, but the U.N. General Assembly subsequently revoked South Africa's mandate, while in 1971 the International Court of Justice issued an \"advisory opinion\" declaring South Africa's continued administration to be illegal.", "vec_id": 1574, "keywords_text": ["1915", "1919", "1946", "1966", "1971", "africa", "ethiopia", "european", "german", "herero", "league_of_nations", "liberia", "namibia", "parliament_of_south_africa", "south-west_africa'", "south_africa", "south_africa's", "south_african", "the_1950s", "the_1960s", "the_international_court_of_justice", "the_swa_legislative_assembly", "the_u.n._general_assembly", "the_united_nations", "un", "united_nations", "world_war_i"], "IQs": ["Here is the JSON response with the generated questions:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the lead singer of the band?\", \"What genre of music does the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' belong to?\", \"What is the name of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the producer of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the label that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the engineer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the mixer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the mastering engineer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the artwork designer who worked on the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the photographer who took the cover photo for the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \""], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

In response to these questions, the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church. The encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus from 24 June 1967, confirms the traditional Church teaching, that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests. Celibacy symbolizes the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society. The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood.

In 1994 the first multi-party elections were held in Malawi, and Banda was defeated by Bakili Muluzi (a former Secretary General of the MCP and former Banda Cabinet Minister). Re-elected in 1999, Muluzi remained president until 2004, when Dr. Bingu wa Mutharika was elected. Although the political environment was described as \"challenging\", it was stated in 2009 that a multi-party system still existed in Malawi. Multiparty parliamentary and presidential elections were held for the fourth time in Malawi in May 2009, and President Mutharika was successfully re-elected, despite charges of election fraud from his rival.President Mutharika was seen by some as increasingly autocratic and dismissive of human rights, and in July 2011 protests over high costs of living, devolving foreign relations, poor governance and a lack of foreign exchange reserves erupted. The protests left 18 people dead and at least 44 others suffering from gunshot wounds. In April 2012, Mutharika died of a heart attack; the presidential title was taken over by former Vice-President Joyce Banda.In 2014 Joyce Banda lost elections (coming third) and was replaced by Arthur Peter Mutharika, the brother of ex-President Mutharika.", "vec_id": 1611, "keywords_text": ["1993", "1994", "1999", "2004", "2009", "2014", "april_2012", "arthur_peter_mutharika", "bakili_muluzi", "banda", "banda_cabinet", "bingu", "joyce_banda", "july_2011", "late_1993", "malawi", "may_2009", "mcp", "muluzi", "mutharika"], "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the given sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here are some follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who is the lead singer of the band?\", \"What genre of music does the band specialize in?\", \"What is the name of the band?\", \"What is the name of the producer of the album?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album?\", \"What is the name of the album's lead single?\", \"What is the name of the album's second single?\", \"What is the name of the album's third single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fourth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's fifth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's sixth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's seventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eighth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's ninth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's tenth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's eleventh single?\", \"What is the name of the album's twelfth single?\", \"What is the name of the album's thirteenth single?\", \"What is the name of"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

Priestly celibacy is considered a discipline rather than dogma, and some had expected that it might be relaxed. In response to these questions, the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church. The encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus from 24 June 1967, confirms the traditional Church teaching, that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests. Celibacy symbolizes the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society. The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood. However, during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state, a position which was drastically reversed by John Paul II in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 Canon Law that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization.", "vec_id": 1665, "keywords_text": ["1980", "1983", "24_june_1967", "church", "john_paul_ii", "latin", "paul_vi", "roman_catholic", "sacerdotalis", "the_catholic_church", "the_catholic_church's", "vatican_ii", "west"], "IQs": ["Here is the JSON response with the generated questions:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is their eighth studio album, '(How to Live) As Ghosts', scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate follow-up questions based on a few consecutive sentences from a news article or biographical text:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What was the inspiration behind the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who produced the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Did the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' receive any critical acclaim?\", \"What other albums has the band released before '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"How did the band prepare for the release of '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the significance of the title '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the genre of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Did the band tour to promote the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the lead singer of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the drummer of"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.", "vec_id": 1776, "keywords_text": ["1843", "as_late_as_1848", "chopin", "george_sand", "harold_c._schonberg", "hiller", "liszt", "marie_d'agoult's", "études"], "IQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate questions based on the provided sentence list:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the name of their eighth studio album?\",\"When is the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?\"]}"], "OQs": ["Here is an example of how I would generate follow-up questions based on the given sentences:", "json {\"Question List\":[\"What is the significance of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"Who produced the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the genre of the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the lead singer of the band that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the record label that released the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the album that preceded '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the album that followed '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the band's previous album that was released before '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the band's previous album that was released after '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?\", \"What is the name of the band's previous album that was released around the same time as '(How to"], "num_iq": 2, "num_oq": 4, "cs_used": null, "hoprag_version": "baseline_hoprag", "dataset": "musique", "split": "train", "generation_model": "qwen-7b"}

The trigger for the Rebellion has been a subject of controversy. The resistance, although short - lived, was triggered by British East India Company attempts to expand its control of India. According to Olson, several reasons may have triggered the Rebellion. For example, Olson concludes that the East India Company's attempt to annexe and expand its direct control of India, by arbitrary laws such as Doctrine of Lapse, combined with employment discrimination against Indians, contributed to the 1857 Rebellion. The East India Company officers lived like princes, the company finances were in shambles, and the company's effectiveness in India was examined by the British crown after 1858. As a result, the East India Company lost its powers of government and British India formally came under direct British rule, with an appointed Governor - General of India.

The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.
