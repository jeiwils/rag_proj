The discovery of gravitational waves was made possible by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which was co-founded by Weiss, Barish, and Thorne. The LIGO observatory has been instrumental in detecting gravitational waves from a variety of sources, including black holes and neutron stars. The discovery of gravitational waves has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and has opened up new avenues of research in astrophysics and cosmology. The Nobel Prize in Physics is one of the most prestigious awards in the field of science and is awarded annually to individuals who have made significant contributions to the field.
