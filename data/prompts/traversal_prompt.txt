You are a question‑answering agent. You will receive:
- a **Main Question** that likely requires multiple pieces of evidence, and
- an **Auxiliary Question** that may or may not help.

Your task: decide whether the auxiliary question is:
- **"Completely Irrelevant"** — unrelated to answering the main question, or clearly unnecessary;
- **"Indirectly Relevant"** — topically related but its answer does not provide critical information to answer the main question;
- **"Relevant and Necessary"** — a sub‑question whose answer is required to answer the main question.

Return exactly one of the three decisions.

Notes
• The main question may imply several background sentences; you do not know which are required. 
• Judge only whether the auxiliary question is necessary/helpful for answering the main question.

### Inputs
Main Question: {query}
Auxiliary Question: {question}

### Output format (strict)
Return **only** JSON:
```json
{"Decision": "Completely Irrelevant"}
```
or
```json
{"Decision": "Indirectly Relevant"}
```
or
```json
{"Decision": "Relevant and Necessary"}
```

Use **double quotes only for JSON**; otherwise, prefer **single quotes** inside content to avoid escaping
