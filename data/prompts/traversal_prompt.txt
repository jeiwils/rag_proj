You are a question-answering robot. I will provide you with a main question that involves multiple pieces of information, as well as an additional auxiliary question. Your task is to answer the main question, but since the main question involves a lot of information that you may not know, you have the opportunity to use the auxiliary question to gather the information you need. However, the auxiliary question may not always be useful, so you need to assess the relationship between the auxiliary and the main question to determine whether or not to use it.

You need to assess whether the auxiliary question is completely irrelevant, indirectly relevant, or relevant and necessary for answering the main question. You can only return one of these three outcomes.

Please note that the main question will involve multiple background sentences, meaning that answering the main question requires the combination and reasoning of several pieces of information. However, you do not know which specific sentences are necessary to answer the main question. Your task is to assess whether the given auxiliary question is relevant and necessary, indirectly relevant, or completely irrelevant in answering the main question.

Result 1: [Completely Irrelevant]
In this case, you find that the auxiliary question is unrelated to the main question, because it is answered by a fact or topic that is completely outside the scope of the main question. The auxiliary question does not help answer the main question at all. Your response should be:

{"Decision" : "Completely Irrelevant"}


Result 2: [Indirectly Relevant]
In this case, you find that the auxiliary question itself does not directly answer the main question, but its answer is part of the background information that may eventually be useful for answering the main question. The auxiliary question focuses on a related topic, but does not provide necessary information for answering the main question. Your response should be:

{"Decision" : "Indirectly Relevant"}


Result 3: [Relevant and Necessary]
In this case, you find that the auxiliary question is a sub-question of the main question, that its answer is directly needed to answer the main question, and that without the auxiliary question it would not be possible to answer the main question. The information provided by the auxiliary question is necessary to answer the main question. Your response should be:

{"Decision" : "Relevant and Necessary"}


Example of Result 1:
Main Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Auxiliary Question: What is the purpose of the State of the Union address presented by the President of the United States?
In this case, after careful consideration, you find that the auxiliary question does not help answer the main question. The auxiliary question is completely unrelated to the main question. Your response should be:
{"Decision" : "Completely Irrelevant"}


Example of Result 2:
Main Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Auxiliary Question: What is the significance of this league for second teams in the region?
In this case, you notice that both the main and auxiliary questions involve similar topics, but the auxiliary question does not provide direct logic to connect with the main question and its answer does not specify which specific player belongs. Upon careful consideration, you find that the auxiliary question is related, but its answer does not provide any critical information to answer the main question. Your response should be:

{"Decision" : "Indirectly Relevant"}


Example of Result 3:
Main Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Auxiliary Question: In what league does Donald W. 'Donnie' Smith play for in Major League Soccer?
In this case, you find that the auxiliary question is a sub-question that provides necessary information to answer the main question. The auxiliary question directly connects with the main question and provides necessary information to answer the main question. Your response should be:

{"Decision" : "Relevant and Necessary"}


Now please strictly follow the JSON format in your response, avoiding unnecessary escapes, line breaks, or spaces. You should also pay attention that if the text, context for the JSON and list formats, you should replace all double quotes with single quotes. For example, use ['How to Live] As Ghosts' instead of "['How to Live] As Ghosts".

Main Question, Auxiliary Question as follows:
Main Question: {query}
Auxiliary Question: {question}
