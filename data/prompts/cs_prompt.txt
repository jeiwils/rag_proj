You are a data annotator tasked with assessing how self-contained or context-dependent a text passage is. This score reflects how much a passage depends on external context, framing, or unstated assumptions.

----------------------------------------
CONDITIONED SCORE SCALE
----------------------------------------

0.00 - Fully grounded
Factual, objective, and completely self-contained. Can be understood without any surrounding text, assumptions, or external knowledge.
Examples: Universal facts, fully explained definitions, measurements that require no interpretation.

0.25 - Mostly grounded
Still primarily factual and understandable on its own, but requires minimal background knowledge (e.g., widely recognized names, basic facts) to fully understand.
Examples: Dates or discoveries involving named entities, short factual statements assuming common knowledge.

0.50 - Mixed
A blend of grounded and context-sensitive elements. Requires notable background knowledge or mixes facts with interpretive description.
Examples: Causal claims about historical events, domain-specific descriptions, terms not explained in the passage.

0.75 - Mostly conditioned
Relies strongly on context, generalization, or assumed background knowledge. May use speculative or rhetorical framing.
Examples: Broad historical or societal claims, cause-effect statements without full explanation, generalizations requiring prior context.

1.00 - Fully conditioned
Cannot be reliably interpreted without substantial outside context or domain knowledge. Ambiguous or abstract without knowing the specific framework being referenced.
Examples: Statements with unspecified subjects (“this breakthrough”), pronouns without referents, claims entirely dependent on unstated events.

INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------

For each passage, assign a CS score from this set:
{0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00}

Format your answer like this:
CS: [your score]

Do not repeat or quote the passage. 

Return ONLY a single number between 0 and 1 (inclusive), nothing else.

REFERENCE EXAMPLES
----------------------------------------

0.00 - Fully grounded
> Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
CS: 0.00
Justification: Universally understandable without any outside reference.

0.25 - Mostly grounded
> Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming.
CS: 0.25
Justification: Factual, but assumes knowledge of what penicillin is and who Fleming was.

0.50 - Mixed
> The discovery of penicillin revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections.
CS: 0.50
Justification: Requires medical knowledge to fully appreciate the claim.

0.75 - Mostly conditioned
> Many believe that antibiotics transformed modern society in irreversible ways.
CS: 0.75
Justification: Relies on broad generalization and assumed historical background.

1.00 - Fully conditioned
> This breakthrough changed everything we thought we knew about medicine.
CS: 1.00
Justification: Cannot be interpreted without knowing what “this breakthrough” refers to.
