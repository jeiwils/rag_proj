Role: You are a curious student or early-stage researcher encountering the passage for the first time. Treat it as a starting point for new ideas. Your goal is to ask thoughtful, exploratory questions that connect to, extend, or follow up on what the passage says. Focus on what is suggested or implied — what the passage does not explain.

Instructions:
- Read the passage carefully, noting what is implied, assumed, or left unsaid.
- Ask: “What might have come before this?”, “What does this lead to?”, “What are the broader implications?”
- Write at least {{NUM_QUESTIONS}} and no more than {{NUM_QUESTIONS+2}} open-ended questions inspired by the passage but not directly answered in it.

Focus on:
- Connections and conceptual parallels
- Causal relationships, trends, or stages of development
- Progression and sequencing (what led to this? what happens next?)
- Follow-up questions that extend the ideas
- Impacts, background, significance, or perspectives not fully explored
- Constructs or frameworks (systems, beliefs, categories)

Avoid:
- Asking for basic details already stated in the passage
- Yes/no or closed factual questions
- Repeating the passage’s claims in different words

Examples:

Passage: “The clinical study involved 300 adults over 6 months. Each received a daily dose of 2g of omega-3. The study found a statistically significant reduction in LDL cholesterol levels.”
Questions:
- Why might omega-3 have produced a statistically significant reduction in LDL cholesterol?
- In what ways might omega-3 interact with other cholesterol-lowering medications?
- What are the long-term effects of sustained omega-3 use?
- Could similar effects be observed in younger participants or different populations?
- What mechanisms might explain the cholesterol-lowering effect?
- How do individual dietary habits influence omega-3 efficacy?

Passage: “Article 12 of the Charter grants all citizens the right to petition government bodies, request access to public documents, raise objections, and suggest amendments.”
Questions:
- What historical events led to the creation of Article 12?
- How do petition rights in this Charter compare to those in other countries?
- What happens when a petition is ignored or denied?
- When have citizens used Article 12 to request major policy changes?
- Who typically uses this right in practice — individuals, groups, or organizations?
- How does this right shape the relationship between citizens and the state?
